# Prodigy InfoTech Internship : Task 2 :
🚢 Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :

📝 Project Overview : 
This project focuses on performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between various features (such as passenger age, gender, ticket class, etc.) and identify patterns that may have influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster.

📊 Dataset :
The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers, including:
🧍‍♂️🧍‍♀️ Survival: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
🎟️ Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third).
📛 Name: Name of the passenger.
👤 Sex: Gender of the passenger.
👶 Age: Age of the passenger.
👨‍👩‍👦 SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
👨‍👧 Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
🎫 Ticket: Ticket number.
💵 Fare: Fare paid by the passenger.
🏠 Cabin: Cabin number.
⚓ Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

🛠️ Steps in the Project :
1. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Handle missing data in columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Convert categorical variables like Sex and Embarked into numerical values for analysis.
Drop unnecessary or redundant columns like Cabin.
2. 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :
📈 Univariate Analysis: Explore individual columns, e.g., the distribution of passengers' ages, gender, or ticket class.
🔗 Bivariate Analysis: Investigate relationships between two variables, such as how survival rates differ by age, gender, or class.
📊 Multivariate Analysis: Analyze the combined effect of multiple factors on survival (e.g., age, class, and fare).
3. 💡 Key Insights :
-Discover patterns and trends in the data, such as the influence of age, gender, or class on survival.
-Highlight interesting findings, like which groups of passengers had higher survival rates.
🛠️ Tools and Libraries :
🐍 Python: The programming language used for data analysis.
🐼 Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
📊 Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

📌 Conclusion
This analysis provides insights into the factors that may have influenced survival on the Titanic. The findings can be used to build a predictive model for future studies.
